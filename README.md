https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf23cd74-e572-4ce8-9a53-86b755e667fd

This project introduces a sophisticated custom implementation of the YOLOv8 object detection framework, specifically designed to address the critical challenge of detecting small objects with enhanced accuracy and precision.

Project Objectives:
- Develop a specialized object detection solution that significantly improves performance for identifying small objects (less than 32x32 pixels)
- Create a flexible, adaptable machine learning approach that can be applied across various detection scenarios

Key Technical Innovations:
1. SmallObjectLoss Function
   - Introduces a specialized loss calculation mechanism tailored for small object detection
   - Implements a dynamic scaling factor to emphasize and improve detection of minute objects
   - Provides nuanced handling of objects traditionally challenging to identify

2. Customized Detection Model
   - Extends standard YOLOv8 architecture with advanced small object detection capabilities
   - Enables fine-tuned configuration of detection sensitivity
   - Supports dynamic threshold and loss scaling parameters
